Scientific analysis, originally written as a term paper for the course "Scientific Programming with R" by Andreas Bl√§tte at the University of Duisburg-Essen in the winter semester 2017/18.

The analysis was done with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and is completely reproducible using the [provided script](https://github.com/Studentenfutter/tv-duell-2013/blob/master/TV-Duell_2013_Florian_Gilberg.Rmd). All that is required for a successfuly reproducing is downloading the survey data sets from the GESIS website (https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?db=E&id=56510) and save them in the *dirSPSSFiles* folder, since the retrieval of the files requires a personal login and therefore cannot be done automatically from R.

Downloading the [HTML version of this document](https://github.com/Studentenfutter/tv-duell-2013/blob/master/TV-Duell_2013_Florian_Gilberg.html) and opening it locally in a browser is recommended.
