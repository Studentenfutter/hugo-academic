I am an ambitious student of political science about to graduate with a Master's degree. During my studies, I
have acquired a versatile skill set in text mining and data visualization with R. I love to explore and visualize data and try out new things.

Over the last year I gained extensive knowledge in the ﬁeld of corpus linguistics during my work as a scientiﬁc assistant for Prof. Andreas Blätte. I am looking to broaden my knowledge in the ﬁeld of Computational Social Sciences in view of a possible Ph.D.
